# Space Data Dashboard (SDD) Flood Trigger

A web-based rainfall visualization dashboard built with **React**, **Vite**, and **MapLibre GL JS**. The application retrieves both **Synoptic Station** and **Automatic Weather Station (AWS)** rainfall observations from the **Panahon API**, visualizes them as interactive map layers, and computes the average forecast rainfall within Sentinel-1 footprint polygons using pre-generated sampling points.

> **Note**
>
> This application visualizes **rainfall observations and forecast rainfall only**. It does **not** represent flood extent, flood susceptibility, or flood risk.

# Panahon API Integration

## Synoptic Stations

Observed rainfall stations:

```text
/api/v1/synop?parameter=rain
```

Represents **3-hour accumulated rainfall**.

---

## Automatic Weather Stations (AWS)

Observed AWS stations:

```text
/api/v1/aws?parameter=accumulated_rain_1h
```

Although the endpoint returns hourly rainfall, this dashboard visualizes the **24_hr_value** field.

---

## Forecast Rainfall Sampling

Forecast rainfall is retrieved from:

```text
/api/v1/tiles/point
```

using:

- latitude
- longitude
- forecast timestamp
- API token

Forecast timestamps are generated automatically using `timeUtils.js`.

---

# Rainfall Station Types

## Synoptic Stations

Visualized using:

- `value`
- 3-hour rainfall
- rainfall station popup

---

## AWS Stations

Visualized using:

- `24_hr_value`
- 24-hour accumulated rainfall
- identical popup layout

---

# Raw API Response

Example Synoptic rainfall station response:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": [
    {
      "site_id": "132",
      "site_name": "ITBAYAT, BATANES",
      "lat": "20.79000758",
      "lon": "121.8396475",
      "value": "0",
      "parameter": "rain",
      "observed_at": "2026-06-30 14:00:00",
      "readable_parameter": "3 Hourly Rain",
      "readable_unit": "mm"
    }
  ]
}
```

Example AWS rainfall station response:

```json
{
	"success":true,
	"data": [
		{
			"site_id":"98",
			"site_name":"Science Garden, Quezon City",
			"lat":14.645101,
			"lon":121.044258,
			"parameter":"accumulated_rain_1h",
			"readable_parameter":"Hourly Rain",
			"readable_unit":"mm",
			"observed_at":"2026-07-06 14:40:00",
			"value":"0",
			"24_hr_value":"0"
		}
	]
}	
```

# Normalized Rainfall Station Object

Before visualization, the API response is converted into a standardized format.

Example normalized Synoptic rainfall station response:

```javascript
{
  id: "132",
  stationName: "ITBAYAT, BATANES",
  latitude: 20.79000758,
  longitude: 121.8396475,
  rainfallMm: 0,
  observedAt: "2026-06-30 14:00:00",
  raw: { ... }
}
```

Example normalized AWS rainfall station response:

```javascript
{
  id: "98",
  latitude: 14.645101,
  longitude: 121.044258,
  rainfallMm: 0,
  observedAt: "2026-06-30 14:00:00",
  raw: { ... },
	readableUnit: "mm",
	stationName: "Science Garden, Quezon City",
	stationType: "aws"
}
```

# API Field Mapping

| Panahon API | Parsed Field | Description |
|-------------|--------------|-------------|
| `site_id` | `id` | Station identifier |
| `site_name` | `stationName` | Station name |
| `lat` | `latitude` | Latitude |
| `lon` | `longitude` | Longitude |
| `value` | `rainfallMm` | Rainfall amount (millimeters) |
| `observed_at` | `observedAt` | Observation timestamp |

The original API response is preserved in the `raw` property.

# Sentinel-1 Footprints

Sentinel-1 acquisition footprints are loaded from:

```
public/data/s1a_footprints.geojson
```

Each footprint:

- displays average forecast rainfall
- is color-coded
- supports interactive popups

---

# Sampling Points

Each footprint uses pre-generated sample coordinates stored in:

```
public/data/footprintSamplePoints.json
```

Advantages:

- deterministic results
- improved performance
- reproducible averages
- easy increase in sampling density

---

# Average Rainfall Computation

For every footprint:

1. Load predefined sample points.
2. Fetch rainfall at every point.
3. Execute requests concurrently.
4. Compute the arithmetic mean.
5. Store as:

```javascript
feature.properties.averageRainfall
```

---

# Layer Controls

The dashboard includes a control panel that allows users to independently toggle:

- Synoptic Stations
- AWS Stations
- Sentinel-1 Footprints

Layer visibility is managed using MapLibre's `layout.visibility` property without reloading map sources.

---

# Station Popups

Clicking either a Synoptic or AWS station displays:

- Station name
- Rainfall amount
- Observation time
- Latitude
- Longitude

The rainfall label automatically changes depending on station type:

- Synoptic → **Rainfall (3h)**
- AWS → **Rainfall (24h)**

---

# Footprint Popups

Clicking a Sentinel-1 footprint displays:

- Tile Number
- Average Forecast Rainfall (mm)

---

# Loading States

The application provides feedback during data retrieval.

- Loading
- Error
- Empty state

---

# Development Notes

- React manages application state.
- MapLibre GL JS renders all spatial layers.
- Layer rendering has been modularized into dedicated map layer components.
- Turf.js generated the initial sampling points.
- Sampling points are reused between application runs.
- Forecast rainfall requests execute concurrently using `Promise.all()`.
- Forecast timestamps are generated dynamically.
- API responses are normalized before visualization.
- Environment variables are accessed using `import.meta.env`.

---

# Troubleshooting

## Missing API Token

```
Missing VITE_PANAHON_API_TOKEN
```

Verify:

- `.env` exists
- the token is defined
- the development server has been restarted

---

## Style is not done loading

```
Style is not done loading
```

Ensure MapLibre sources and layers are only added after the map's `load` event.

---

## GitHub Pages Displays a Blank Page

Verify:

- `vite.config.js` contains the correct `base` path
- assets use `import.meta.env.BASE_URL`
- GitHub Pages is configured to deploy from the `gh-pages` branch
- redeploy using:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

---

## No Stations Displayed

Verify:

- the API token is valid
- the Panahon API requests succeed
- valid coordinates are returned
- browser Developer Tools report no JavaScript errors

---

## Incorrect Footprint Rainfall

Verify:

- the generated forecast timestamp matches the latest available forecast
- `footprintSamplePoints.json` contains valid coordinates
- the Panahon forecast endpoint returns valid values
